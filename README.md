- You've started, which is good. reply: Thanks
- Not enough commits + change log items to get above a Pass at this frequency. reply: will update all the data this week
- I can't find your game's data files (e.g. JSON files)? Create a root folder "data/", and put all your text-based data files in there.
reply: for JSON and others will be under /game_feature/src/main/assets
need feedback: Do I need to move it to another short path?
